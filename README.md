For first problem I used the following source to learn a little more about yfinance and how to dowload data:

In this first source, I got examples of codes that helped me to download the data from YFINANCE, from different tickers. Also has examples to download more than one ticker at the same time and even for a period of time we wanted. This source also has an example to plot the data donwloaded.

Also, in below source, I got the information required to configure the data frame for the CSV created on the problem 1

https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#format-codes

In problem 2 we applied something new : os.makedirs() this checks that the directory exist, if it doesn't exist would create it.

os.path librery

https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html

os.path.join
I found this function that can read multiples path at the same time, what is helpful in this case since I have many files in data folder.
In each sources there are different examples and explanations of how it works.

os.path.getmtime
Return the time of last modification of path.
